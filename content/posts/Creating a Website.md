# TL;DR

Hastily tried making a website and purchasing a domain name and ended up making more work for myself.

# Full Story

Today, 14 May 2022, I decided I was going to create a website. After watching a [great video](https://youtu.be/gwUz3E9AW0w) by [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck) on YouTube, I was feeling confident. I’ve worked in IT for about three and a half years at this point and despite not having any experience with website creation, NetworkChuck’s video was straightforward and I figured I’d fiddle my way through it.

Fiddle I did and before long I had followed his video and setup my account on [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/). I also went ahead and purchased a domain name through there (this was mistake number one). As I said, I have no experience in website creation or domain name management. After purchasing the domain name, I’d realized that you can also just purchase through WordPress, which, since I was going to be managing this site through WordPress anyhow, would’ve made the most sense.

After trying to transfer the domain name to WordPress I came across a new issue… You can’t transfer a domain name for the first 60 days of ownership. Of course you can’t. That would be too easy… Anyways, I decided I wanted a different domain name anyhow after some contemplation about what I wanted the site name and whatnot to be. So, I bought another domain name, this time through WordPress (this was mistake number two).

After purchasing this new domain name I realized that [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) exists. As somebody who lives in the Google Ecosystem, THIS would have made the most sense by far as the place to purchase and manage any and all domain names through for me. Unfortunately, as I already mentioned, I can’t transfer this domain name for another 60 days. Which isn’t the end of the world, it’s just frustrating.

The moral of the story is to, unlike me in this instance, be continually, Living Kairos.
